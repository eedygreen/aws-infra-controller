# aws-infra-controller

The aws-infra-controller manages the AWS infrastructure of your Kubernetes cluster for you.

## Status

This project is a proof-of-concept work in progress.  The instructions below will spin up a single-node Kubernetes cluster in AWS but more useful infra management functionality is still in development.

## Prerequisites

* have [packer](https://www.packer.io/) installed
* have an AWS account with credentials for API access
* put AWS credentials in your environment

## Build Machine Image

Build the machine image and take note of the resulting AMI ID:

    $ make machine-image

## Edit Cluster Config

Set the following in `config/samples/infra_v1alpha1_cluster.yaml`:
    * `metadata.name`: arbitrary name for your cluster
    * `spec.region`: AWS region

## Edit Machine Config

Set the following in `config/samples/infra_v1alpha1_machine.yaml`:
    * `ami`: add the AMI from the image you built in the previous section
    * `keyName`: a key in AWS you have access to

## Build bootctl

    $ make bootctl

## Install a Cluster

Run the create command with cluster and machine flags, write output to an inventory config in your home directory:

    $ ./bootctl create \
        -c config/samples/infra_v1alpha1_cluster.yaml \
        -m config/samples/infra_v1alpha1_machine.yaml \
        > ~/.aws-infra-controller-inventory.json

## Connect to Cluster

Get the IP address from AWS and connect to your AWS instance:

    $ ssh ubuntu@[ip address]

View the cluster's nodes:

    $ kubectl get nodes

## Destroy the Cluster

Run the destroy command and reference the inventory file generated by the create command:

    $ ./bootctl destroy \
        -i ~/.aws-infra-controller-inventory.json
